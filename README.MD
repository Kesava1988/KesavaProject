#Restaurant Reservation project

In KesavaProject folder you will find index.html, which is the starting file of this static website.

Used HTML5 and CSS3 to develop this website.

Implemented the following:
1. Static design of the RRS.

2. RWD tested for tablet and mobile phone.

3. Static login page and table reservation page, but it doesnt give any confirmation tag or any other details as Javascript is not used.

4. Submit button in login page takes back to home page.

5. When browser size is reduces, the navigation menu collapses. I wanted to implement a drop down in such cases but couldnt do it, needed jquery 
or javascript to implement it. So didnt implement the dropdown menu.
